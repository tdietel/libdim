.SH NAME
dim_dns \- Setup a DNS for DIM
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdim_dns\fR [ \fIOPTIONS\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Setup a DNS for \fbDIM\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-node " NAME"
Specify which IP name or address should be used by clients to connect
to this server, for example if the default host interface is not to be
used.  It can be the IP name (e.g., \fBpclhcb155.cern.ch\fR) or the IP
address (e.g., \fB137.138.214.208\fR).  The default host interface can
be retrieved with the \fBhostname\fR(1). 
.IP
.B Note: 
The DIM Name Server (DNS) is also a Server (DIS_DNS) for replying to
DID and for answering \fBDimBrowser\fR requests.  So DIM_HOST_NODE can
also be set for the DNS in order to choose on which interface it
should answer. 
.TP 
.BI \-port " PORT"
Specify the port number the DNS should serve requests on.  The default
port number is (2505).  For example in order to be able to run two
DNSs in the same machine. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 
.B DIM_HOST_NODE
Specify which IP name or address should be used by clients to connect
to this server, for example if the default host interface is not to be
used.  It can be the IP name (e.g., \fBpclhcb155.cern.ch\fR) or the IP
address (e.g., \fB137.138.214.208\fR).  The default host interface can
be retrieved with the \fBhostname\fR(1).
