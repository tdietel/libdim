libdim 16.03

This directory contains a minimalistic, stripped DIM libarary. It is
intended to be used on DCS boards, where disk space is very limited.
On a normal, non-embedded system, an RPM should be preferred [1,2].

This library has been taken from an InterCom Layer release, and been
modified to use autoconf/automake for the build process, allowing for
simple installation with `./configure && make && make install`, with
the usual options, e.g. for cross builds and non-default directories.
If you checked out the software directly from the repository, you need
to call `./bootstrap` to initialize the autotools.

The package also includes support for building an ipkg. If the
ipkg-utils and fakeroot are installed (available at [2]), this can be
done by executing `fakeroot ipkg-buildpackage` after bootstrapping and 
configuring the package.
